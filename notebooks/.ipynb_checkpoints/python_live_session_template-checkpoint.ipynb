Using Jupyter Notebooks you'll learn how to efficiently create, evaluate, and tune XGBoost models. This session will run for three hours, allowing you time to really immerse yourself in the subject, and includes short breaks and opportunities to ask the expert questions throughout the training. \n",

The data is originally from an article called [Hotel booking demand datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It was then cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md). For the purposes of this live training, it was further pre-processed to have cleaner ready-to-use features (e.g., dropping of irrelevant columns, one-hot-encoding).
