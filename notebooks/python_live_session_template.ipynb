    "# **Machine Learning with XGboost**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on training where we will learn how to use XGBoost to create powerful prediction models using gradient boosting. Using Jupyter Notebooks you'll learn how to efficiently create, evaluate, and tune XGBoost models. This session will run for three hours, allowing you time to really immerse yourself in the subject, and includes short breaks and opportunities to ask the expert questions throughout the training. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to instantiate and customize XGBoost models\n",
    "- How to use XGBoost's DMatrix to optimize performance\n",
    "- How to evaluate models in XGBoost using the right metrics\n",
    "- How to tune parameters in XGBoost to achieve the best results\n",
    "- How to visualize trees in XGBoost to analyze feature importance\n",

    "The dataset to be used in this webinar is a CSV file named `hotel_bookings_clean.csv`, which contains data on hotel bookings. \n",

    "The dataset was downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/). The data is originally from an article called [Hotel booking demand datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It was then cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md). For the purposes of this live training, it was further pre-processed to have cleaner ready-to-use features (e.g., dropping of irrelevant columns, one-hot-encoding).
